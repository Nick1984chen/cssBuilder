# cssBuilder
This is a php program, help you to build a css file. Need php environment and unix-like environment.

there are two test you can find on the dir. One is test.php, and the other is min-text.php. You can work it to see the difference between test.php and min-test.php.

to work it, you need to do this thing under shell:

$ php test.php > test.css

or

$ php min-test.php > test.min.css


At this time, the css-builder still have some bugs and I haven't finish all the css library. So, if you want to use it, maybe you will find some of normal css can't be used. I am finishing all the library. Before everything finished, I won't suggest you to use the it. So you should think about it before you use it. 

This library just suit for my personal habit. So, maybe you will find it hard to use. I want to know your habit on building css file, that can help me to build a friendly css-builder. So, I need you to help me.

By the way, I need a freelancer job for me. So that I can have money to buy a new computer, my computer almost done at this moment. I need a job. So if some one who can support me a freelancer job. I will be so happy.
